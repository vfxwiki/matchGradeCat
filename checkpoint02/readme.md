Slight Adjustment to Checkpoint01 and trained on larger amount of the data set and less epocs, but otherwise it's the same setup. Prediction is better in this model.

See Checkpoint01 for details.

Train:
this took on a RTX3090 12h to train and about and 5h to cache using Checkpoint01 as checkpoint / 666 epocs / 1210909 steps / 1000000 frames
