Slight Adjustment to Checkpoint01 but trained on larger amount of the data set and less epocs, but otherwise it's the same setup. Prediction is better in this model.

See Checkpoint01 for details.

Train:
this took on a RTX3090 5h to train and about and 1h to cache using Checkpoint01 as checkpoint

I've no longer have access to Nuke so not able to test this model
